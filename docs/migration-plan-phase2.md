# FRC Project Management System Migration
## Phase 2: Database Implementation

### Project Summary
The FRC Project Management System is being migrated from a Django web application to a standalone JavaFX desktop application with H2 Database. This migration will result in a cross-platform desktop application that maintains all the functionality of the current system while providing better performance and offline capabilities.

### Current Progress
- Phase 1 completed: Project setup and architecture design
- Java development environment configured
- Basic application shell created
- Data models defined as Java classes
- Application architecture designed

### Phase 2 Objectives
1. Set up H2 Database integration
2. Implement database schema generation
3. Create data migration strategy from Django SQLite
4. Develop repository layer for data access
5. Implement basic CRUD operations for all entities
6. Configure connection pooling and transaction management

### Technical Details

#### H2 Database Integration
- Embedded database mode
- File-based storage with versioning
- Connection configuration in `application.properties`
- Database initialization scripts

#### Schema Design
```sql
-- Example schema for Project table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS project (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description CLOB,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    goal_end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    hard_deadline DATE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Additional tables will follow similar patterns
```

#### Repository Layer
Each entity requires a repository interface and implementation:

```java
public interface ProjectRepository {
    Optional<Project> findById(Long id);
    List<Project> findAll();
    Project save(Project project);
    void delete(Project project);
    void deleteById(Long id);
    // Custom query methods
}

public class ProjectRepositoryImpl implements ProjectRepository {
    private final DataSource dataSource;
    
    // Implementation of interface methods
}
```

#### Database Migration Utility
- Tool to import data from Django SQLite database
- Mapping between Django models and Java entities
- Data validation and transformation logic
- Progress reporting

#### Connection Pooling
- HikariCP implementation
- Connection pool configuration
- Pool sizing and timeout settings

#### Transaction Management
- Service-level transaction boundaries
- Declarative transaction management
- Rollback policies

### Deliverables
1. H2 Database integration with configuration
2. Schema creation scripts and versioning
3. Complete repository layer implementation
4. Database migration utility
5. Connection pool configuration
6. Transaction management implementation
7. Database unit tests

### Next Steps
Once Phase 2 is complete, Phase 3 will focus on:
- Migrating core business logic from Python to Java
- Implementing service classes
- Creating validation rules
- Developing business processes

### Required Information for Development
- Django database schema details
- Sample SQLite database for testing migration
- Business logic requirements from the existing system
- Transaction boundaries and integrity constraints
