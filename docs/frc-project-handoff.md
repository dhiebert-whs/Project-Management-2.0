# FRC Project Management System Migration
## Comprehensive Handoff Document

## Project Overview

The FRC Project Management System is a specialized application designed for FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) high school teams to efficiently manage their robot build season. The application provides comprehensive tools for project planning, task management, team organization, attendance tracking, and progress visualization tailored specifically to the unique constraints and requirements of FRC teams working with limited time between kickoff and competition.

### Purpose & Goals
The primary purpose is to migrate the existing Django web application to a JavaFX desktop application with an H2 database backend. This migration aims to:

1. Create a standalone desktop application that can run without Internet connectivity
2. Improve performance for resource-intensive operations
3. Provide a more native user experience with standard desktop application patterns
4. Maintain data compatibility with the previous system
5. Add new features specific to FRC team needs

### Target Users
- Team mentors/coaches
- Student team leaders
- Subteam leads
- Team members

### Key Features
- Project timeline management with FRC-specific milestones
- Task dependency tracking and critical path analysis
- Subteam organization and member management
- Meeting scheduling and attendance tracking
- Gantt chart visualization
- Component/part tracking and supply chain integration
- Project export/import for backups and sharing

## Technical Architecture

The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with additional layers:

1. **Model Layer**: JPA entities representing the domain objects
2. **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction using the Repository pattern
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic and transaction management
4. **Controller Layer**: JavaFX controllers handling UI logic
5. **View Layer**: FXML-based UI components

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Java 17
- **UI Framework**: JavaFX 17
- **Database**: H2 Database (embedded)
- **ORM**: Hibernate/JPA
- **Connection Pooling**: HikariCP
- **Build System**: Maven
- **Testing**: JUnit 5

## Key Design Considerations

### Menu Structure
The application will have a comprehensive menu structure:

1. **File Menu**: Project management operations
2. **Edit Menu**: Standard editing operations
3. **View Menu**: Navigation between different views
4. **Project Menu**: Context-specific project operations
5. **Team Menu**: Team and subteam management
6. **Tools Menu**: Utilities and settings
7. **Help Menu**: Documentation and about information

All menus will support standard keyboard shortcuts and will adapt based on the current application state.

### Database Design
The database schema closely follows the entity model with proper relationships and constraints:
- Projects are the central organizing entity
- Tasks belong to projects and can have dependencies on other tasks
- Team members can be assigned to multiple tasks
- Attendance records link team members to meetings
- Components can be required by multiple tasks

### User Interface Guidelines
- Follow standard desktop UI patterns and conventions
- Provide context-sensitive menus and toolbars
- Use consistent keyboard shortcuts
- Implement drag-and-drop where appropriate
- Provide visual feedback for long-running operations
- Support undo/redo for critical operations
- Use color-coding for visual identification (subteams, task priority)

## Technical Specifications for Continuing Development

### Development Environment Setup
1. **Requirements**:
   - JDK 17 or higher
   - Maven 3.8 or higher
   - IDE with JavaFX support (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)

4. **End-to-end tests** for key features

## Migration Challenges and Solutions

### Data Migration
- The application needs to import data from the Django JSON format
- A custom import mechanism is needed to translate data structures
- Versioning should be implemented to handle future format changes

### UI Translation
- The Django templates need to be translated to JavaFX FXML
- Styling should be standardized across the application
- Client-side validations need to be reimplemented

### Business Logic
- Server-side validation needs to be moved to the service layer
- Transactional boundaries need to be established
- Concurrent access patterns need to be handled

## Conclusion

The FRC Project Management System migration project is a comprehensive effort to transform a web application into a desktop application while maintaining functionality and improving user experience. Phase 1 has established the foundation with the data model, basic architecture, and UI structure. Phase 2 will focus on implementing the core functionality, while later phases will add advanced features and optimizations.

By following the outlined plan and adhering to the design considerations, the project will deliver a high-quality application tailored to the specific needs of FRC teams, helping them manage their build season more effectively.
