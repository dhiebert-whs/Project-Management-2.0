Description:

The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

┌─────┐
|  securityConfig defined in file [C:\Users\dhiebert\Local Repositories\Project Management 2.0\target\classes\org\frcpm\config\SecurityConfig.class]
↑     ↓
|  userDetailsServiceImpl defined in file [C:\Users\dhiebert\Local Repositories\Project Management 2.0\target\classes\org\frcpm\security\UserDetailsServiceImpl.class]
↑     ↓
|  userServiceImpl defined in file [C:\Users\dhiebert\Local Repositories\Project Management 2.0\target\classes\org\frcpm\services\impl\UserServiceImpl.class]
└─────┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.

Description:

The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

┌─────┐
|  webSocketEventPublisher (field private org.frcpm.web.websocket.TaskUpdateController org.frcpm.events.WebSocketEventPublisher.taskUpdateController)
↑     ↓
|  taskUpdateController (field private org.frcpm.services.TaskService org.frcpm.web.websocket.TaskUpdateController.taskService)
↑     ↓
|  taskServiceImpl defined in file [C:\Users\dhiebert\Local Repositories\Project Management 2.0\target\classes\org\frcpm\services\impl\TaskServiceImpl.class]
└─────┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.
